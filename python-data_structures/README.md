# Data structures in Python
Just like it says on the tin: here we're going to learn data structures in Python. What they are, how they work, and why.<br/>
Maybe not 'why'. Maybe we'll suspend our disbelief a little bit.
## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Code uses pycodestyle version 2.7.*
* All files are executable
* The length of all files will be tested using wc

### Overview
```
The web of our tasks is of a mingled yarn, requirements and correct code output together.<br/>
â€” Shakespeare
```
#### 0. Print a list of integers
You'll never guess what this one does.<br/>
See file `0-print_list_integer.py`.
#### 1. Secure access to an element in a list
Retrieves an element from a list.<br/>
See file `1-element_at.py`.
#### 2. Replace element
Replaces the element found at a specific position in a list. The title didn't give it away, I know.<br/>
See file `2-replace_in_list.py`.
#### 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
Hazard a guess.<br/>
See file `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`. This is 32 characters long (and a null-byte).
#### 4. Replace in a copy
Replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.<br/>
See file `4-new_in_list.py`.
#### 5. Can you C me now?
Removes all characters c and C from a string.<br/>
See file `5-no_c.py`.
#### 6. Lists of lists = Matrix
Prints a matrix of integers.<br/>
See file `6-print_matrix_integer.py`.
#### 7. Tuples addition
Adds two tuples. Just like you could deduce this by adding two and two together.<br/>
See file `7-add_tuple.py`.
#### 8. More returns!
Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.<br/>
See file `8-multiple_returns.py`.
#### 9. Find the max
Finds the biggest integer of a list.<br/>
See file `9-max_integer.py`.
#### 10. Only by 2
Finds all multiples of 2 in a list.<br/>
See file `10-divisible_by_2.py`.
#### 11. Delete at
Deletes the item at a specific position in a list.<br/>
See file `11-delete_at.py`.
#### 12. Switch
Switches value of variables a and b. Completed from source code:
```
#!/usr/bin/python3
a = 89
b = 10

print("a={:d} - b={:d}".format(a, b))
```
See file `12-switch.py`.
