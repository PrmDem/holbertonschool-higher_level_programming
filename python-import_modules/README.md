## Tasks
### General information
__Number of tasks:__ 6<br/>
__Completed:__ 4<br/>
__Passed:__ TBA<br/>
### Detailed overview
Well, relatively detailed. I'm not about to give secrets away here.
#### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file
Imports function `def add(a, b):` from file `add_0.py` and prints result of "1 + 2 = 3". The program should not be executed when __import__ed.<br/>
Related file : `0-add.py`.
#### 1. My first toolbox!
Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result. Only 4 'print' functions allowed!<br/>
Related file: `1-calculation.py`.
#### 2. How to make a script dynamic!
Write a program that prints the number and the list of its arguments.<br/>
Related file: `2-args.py`.
#### 3. Infinite addition
Prints the result of the addition of all arguments.<br/>
Related file: `3-infinite_add.py`.
#### 4. Who are you?
Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.<br/>
Sandbox-only task, nothing to see here!
#### 5. Everything can be imported
Imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.<br/>
Related file: `5-variable_load.py`. Don't get them mixed up!
