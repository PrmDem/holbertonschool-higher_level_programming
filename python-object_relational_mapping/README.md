# Python: Object Relational Mapping
MySQL queries are a lot of fun to write, but only when you've got a lot of time on your hands.<br/>
In order to manipulate our data more easily, we're moving on to greater heights: `SQLAlchemy`.<br/>
Should you be interested in the details of my flailing, failing, and subsequent learning of ORMs, you can head over to the [overview](#overview). If you'd like details on _how_ we're made to learn, you'll find the [requirements](#requirements) right below. Careful not to get that mixed up with the [requirements file](./requirements.txt), of course.<br/>

# Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using __python3__ (version 3.8.5)
* Our files will be executed with __MySQLdb__ version 2.0.x and __SQLAlchemy__ version 1.4.x
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of all our files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Our code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All files must be executable
* The length of our files will be tested using wc
* All modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* The documentation length will be verified
* We are not allowed to use `execute` with __sqlalchemy__
