### Herakles only did twelve
So we have him beat. By just the one, but still.<br/>
We weren't allowed to store what we had to print in a new variable or import modules.
#### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
Prints whether the number stored in the randomised variable `number` is positive or negative.<br/>
Relates to file `0-positive-or-negative.py`.
#### 1. The last digit
Prints the last digit of the number stored in the randomised variable `number`.<br/>
Relates to file `1-last_digit.py`.
#### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, _not_ followed by a new line.<br/>
Relates to file `2-print_alphabet.py`.
#### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
Prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line â€“ except the letters q and e.<br/>
Relates to file `3-print_alphabt.py`.
#### 4. Hexadecimal printing
Prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.<br/>
Relates to file `4-print_hexa.py`.
#### 5. 00...99
Prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by `, `, in ascending order and with two digits.<br/>
We can only use two `print` functions (that have a string format) and one loop.<br/>
Relates to file `5-print_comb2.py`.
#### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
Prints all possible different combinations of two digits, in ascending order, choosing the smallest value of a combination over the highest (e.g. 28 rather than 82).<br/>
Relates to file `6-print_comb3.py`.
#### 7. islower
Checks for lowercase character.<br/>
Relates to file `7-islower.py`.
#### 8. To uppercase
Prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.<br/>
Maximum two (2) `print` functions with string format, one (1) loop, and __no__ (0) module, tr.upper() or str.isupper().<br/>
Relates to file `8-uppercase.py`.
#### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Prints the last digit of a number.<br/>
_(Actually it returns the value of said digit and the __main file__ prints it, but you know. Tom8to tomAHto.)_<br/>
Relates to file `9-print_last_digit.py`.
#### 10. a + b
Adds two integers and returns the result.<br/>
Relates to file `10-add.py`.
#### 11. a ^ b
Computes a to the power of b and returns the value.<br/>
Relates to file `11-pow.py`.
#### 12. Fizz Buzz
The one and only FizzBuzz!<br/>
Relates to file `12-fizzbuzz.py`.
