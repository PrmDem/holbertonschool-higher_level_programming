# First steps in Python
Contains the first exercises through which we get a sense of Python's `print` function's inner workings.
## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Code uses pycodestyle version 2.7.*
* All files are executable
* The length of all files will be tested using wc
## Tasks
### General information
__Number of tasks:__ 8<br/>
__Completed:__ 8<br/>
__Passed:__ TBA<br/>
### The tasks, the myths, the legends
All task requirements specified that everything we print should be followed by a new line.<br/>
As we know, Python's `print` does that on its own and we love it for that.<br/>
